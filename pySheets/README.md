\#Purpose

\##Open a 10x10 cell spreadsheet as a gui run with python, in which:

&nbsp;- rows and columns can be added as a right-click option

&nbsp;- each cell can run basic arithmetic, logic operators, if statements, and, or, not, and cell references. 

&nbsp;- Cells references should be able to be made absolute by short-key "F4", 

&nbsp;- and cells can be dragged-down to copy code to other cels in the same row/column. 

&nbsp;- known logic functions auto-fill as a suggestion to the user, while they are typing their cell functions

&nbsp;- That's it, not extra functions.
